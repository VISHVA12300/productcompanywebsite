            Google LLC is an American multinational technology company focusing on search engine technology, online advertising, cloud computing,
            computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and consumer electronics.
            It has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world"
            and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in 
            the area of artificial intelligence.<br>
            <br>
            Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students 
            at Stanford University in California. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004.
            Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. 
            On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.
            <br>
            The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, 
            many of which hold dominant market positions.
            Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.
